# Symfony CMF Conference Website Tutorial

This is a step by step tutorial how to build a real application with the
[Symfony2 CMF](http://cmf.symfony.com). Each step is explained as a pull
request against the previous step.

If you are interested in having me do a CMF tutorial for you, please get in
[contact](mailto:mail@davidbu.ch).

## Documentation

The master branch is empty. The interesting code is in branches that build on
each other. The first branch 00-symfony-2.3-lts is the Symfony2 Standard
Edition 2.3.13 LTS with the DemoBundle removed. It has no routes configured
and will give you a 404 for the homepage.

The steps are explained as [pull requests](https://github.com/dbu/conference-tutorial/pulls),
each building on the previous branch.

For further information and setup instructions, see the
[project wiki](https://github.com/dbu/conference-tutorial/wiki/Home).
